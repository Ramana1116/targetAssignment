Hello,

I have used Create-react-app boilerplate to setup the project.
I have used antd design which has lot of components designed to meet everyday requirements.

This is a product Catalogue web app created in react with mobx by which user can browse different products, add to cart and checkout(fake checkout as of now).


To run this APP


1.npm install
2.npm start

This  will open the app on localhost:3000

After the app is started
1.Click on add Products button
2.Enter the product information via form
3.Products will be listed along with the product image

Added functionality:
Hard reloading the app will retain the state.

Please let me know for any suggestion and code corrections.
